<h4> Since its founding, Black Mesa has stood at the forefront of innovation, exploring the limits of human knowledge and unlocking the remaining, far-reaching mysteries of known science. Situated in the heart of New Mexico, the Black Mesa Research Facility has grown from a small government-funded laboratory into a global leader in applied sciences and advanced research, recognized for pioneering achievements in fields ranging from theoretical physics, materials science, to biotechnology, aerospace engineering.</h4>
<br>
<p>The Black Mesa Research Facility was originally created in 1952 to be a competitor to the Los Alamos National Laboratory, managed in equal parts by the Lockheed Corporation and the University of New Mexico. Established at the directive of the Atomic Energy Commission at the site of a defunct Army Air Corps test range, the Black Mesa Scientific Laboratory as it was first known was focused on Aerospace Engineering and National Security Research. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, construction projects for rocket assembly and launch facilities were the main source of funding, with atomic energy research and development occurring at the request of the AEC. Well into the 60s, management of the BMSL transferred from Lockheed and the UNM fully to the Atomic Energy Commission. Soon after this change, in 1966, a secondary facility was commissioned to be the site of a Linear Particle Accelerator as well as other projects.</p>
<br><p>With the scope and capability of the research being conducted in BMSL, it was officially given the status of a National Laboratory by Congress in the year 1975. Due to this, BMSL was renamed the Black Mesa Research Facility. With this new support, as well as the backing of Fermilab, a third facility was commissioned for the express purpose of construction and maintainment of the Heavy Relativistic Supercollider, nicknamed the Pueblotron. Construction began in 1986 and ended in 1998, with operations beginning soon after completion. One such operation resulted in the successful observation of the Higgs-Boson particle, earning the BMRF public prominence.</p>
<br><p>Beginning in the 1990s and through to today, Black Mesa has moved away from defense R&D to more civilian fields, such as Alternative Energy, Robotics, Aerospace Engineering, and Materials Science, among other fields. BMRF is now managed jointly by the University of New Mexico and the Department of Energy, with the launch facilities being shared with the Air Force Space Command by Black Mesa. The Black Mesa Research Facility continues to be a pioneer of scientific discovery, being one of the largest and most advanced institutions in the world!</p>
