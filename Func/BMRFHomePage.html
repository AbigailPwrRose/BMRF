<p style=text-align:center>Black Mesa is an American research institure based out of New Mexico, with several auxillary research facilities around the globe.<br><br>Black Mesa is the leading force in applied physics, but we do not limit ourselves; among the research done at our sites, we study everything from lasers to propultion to robotics to genetics. Our studies in this wide range and our centralised research database allows us to perform research and expirements on a level that our competitors cannot matched.<br><br>We at Black Mesa are equal opportunity employers, looking for talent in all places of the world, with several outreach programs in Vietnam, Ukraine, South Africa, Egypt and Brazil. The diverse backgrounds of our staff allow us to aquire insight that would otherwise be unnavailable, giving us yet another advantage over competitors.</p>

<p style=text-align:centre> Black Mesa is a large facility; Originally built out of an abandoned missile silo, the facility has grown to significant size and as such requires accomodations not present at other facilities. One example of these accomodations is the tram system, which allows our staff to traverse the vast expanse of our facility without having to train in marathons(although we do offer a state of the art gymnasium) or traverse the more hazardous parts of the old walkways. <br></p>
<p style=text-align:centre> Another accomodation we provide here is free food, drink and housing to all our staff. In the early days of Black Mesa our staff lived off site in a nearby town, however as our population grew it became nonfeasible to continue to house them off site, so housing was constructed on site. The housing is standardised to a 6x10 metre room, with a bed and desk included by default but additional furniture available at a store near the housing area. Also near the housing area is the cafeteria! A large and expansive area with over a dozen different restaurants which are free to eat at and a kitchen area for cooking your own meals, though no raw ingredients can be provided. As for drinks? Throughout the facility are numerous vending machines and water fountains to quench your thirst.</p>

<p><br>We here at Black Mesa conduct safe and steady research and development. So while our competitors at Apature Science and Anodyne Incorporated are having their inventions blow up in their faces while registering 100's of "discoveries", we are continuously making steady bounds in technology. From our advancements in medicine and hydroponics to our technical know-how, we at Black Mesa are trully the forefront of science!</p>
